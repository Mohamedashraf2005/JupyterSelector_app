# <p align="center">Jupyter Notebook Folder Selector</p>
 
This is a simple Python-based GUI application that allows users to select a folder and open a Jupyter Notebook instance in that directory instead of its default path in the `C directory`. The application is built using the `tkinter` library and dynamically detects the Anaconda installation on the system to activate the environment and start Jupyter Notebook.
